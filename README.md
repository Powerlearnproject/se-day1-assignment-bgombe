Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of engineering that is associated with development of a software product using well defined scientific principles.
Importance: It plays a very crutial role in the industy of technology by enabling the creation of software systems and applications that power of run various aspects of our modern life like communication.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The establishment of software engineering discpline
The rice of agile methodologies in the 2000s
Development of programming languages.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gather and document the user needs in the system.
Design: Create a detailed design of the system architecture and User interface.
Implementetions: Write the code and build the system according tho the system design specifications.
Testing :Conduct various tests to check whether the system meets the quality standards.
Deployment: Release the software to the users  either on play store or apple store.
Maintenece : Provide  ongoing support and updates to the system.




Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential support with disticnt phases like requirments, design and implementation while Agile is an Incremental and iterative approach fthat focuses on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assuarance Engineer: Ensure the system/software  quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project maneger: Oversees the planing, execution and delivery of software products.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: They provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code like Visual studio and Eclipse
VCS: They are software tools that are used to track changes to source code and coordinating work amoung  members like Git.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines.
Changing requirements.
Technical debt.
Stretegies: The employment of Agile methodologies, effective communication, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessments of projrect goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: Is the testing of individual components or modules of a software.
Intergration testing: Testing the interactions of different components or subsystems.
System testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance testing: Testing the software aginst user reqyurments to check it meets the user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of refining and designing inputs to optimize reponses from AI models.
Importance: Optimizes productivity - It reduces trial and error in AI interactions giving the users their desired result.
Improves decision making-In other fields like finance , accurate AI- generated information can  help in providing critical decisions/ advices.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- Tell me about history
Improved prompt- Provide a brief overview of world war II, including what it caused, major events and outcomes, in under 500 words.
Scope control: It focuses on the main key aspects  instead of leaving  it open .
It limits the number of words  under the specified number by the user ensuring a well staright to the point answer.
It defines the exact topic the user gave rather than giving an irrelevant story about the history.
Action oriented: It makes requests direct and well structured.
